### Instructor: Loren Velasquez

Loren Velasquez is a software engineer at divvyDOSE but when she isn’t on the modern typewriter you’ll likely find her lifting, enjoying quality food or being a hermit at home (introvert and proud). She got into data via her interest in statistics when “numbers just made sense”. Her first job was as a Data Consultant where she mainly worked with databases. Being in the data world made her feel like a less archeological Indiana Jones where the data was the jungle, the answer is the ancient artifact and the messy/missing parts of the data are the booby traps slowing down her mission. Nowadays her world has expanded to data + software and has become Loren the self-named Data Bender.
